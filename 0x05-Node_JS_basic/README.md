#  Node JS Basics

## Description
This project focuses on understanding the basics of Node.js, including setting up a simple HTTP server, working with the filesystem, and handling asynchronous operations. The tasks involve creating scripts that showcase the capabilities of Node.js for backend development.

- **0x05-Node_JS_basic/**: Project directory
  - **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
  - **0-stdin.js**: Script that logs data received on `stdin`.
  - **1-stdin_async.js**: Script that logs data received on `stdin` asynchronously.
  - **2-read_file.js**: Script that reads a file and prints its content.
  - **3-read_file_async.js**: Script that reads a file asynchronously and prints its content.
  - **4-http.js**: Script that creates a simple HTTP server using the Node.js `http` module.
  - **utils.js**: Utility functions used across multiple scripts.
  - **database.csv**: Sample CSV file used for file operations in some tasks.

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official website [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Usage
1. **Run a Script**: Navigate to the project directory and use Node.js to run any script, for example:
   ```bash
   node 4-http.js
